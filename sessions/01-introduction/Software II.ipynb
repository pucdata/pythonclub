There are many such systems out there, for example,  <a href=\"http://subversion.apache.org\">Subversion (SVN)</a>, <a href=\"http://mercurial.selenic.com\">Mercurial</a>, and <a href=\"http://bazaar.canonical.com\">Bazaar</a>, all with their own advantages and idiosyncracies, but the one we will talk about here (and encourage you to use this week) is <b>Git</b>.

Firstly, you need to tell git which files in your local directory you want in the master repository - you may decide initially that you want everything in it but you'll soon find that you end up with all sorts of extra stuff in the local repository that you don't need in the master, such as temporary files for testing, random notes, coffee shop receipts, etc. So for each file that you want to <b>add</b>:\n",
